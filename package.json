  "description": "Use snapshots from a camera connected to Homey, and let Face++ do AI based face recognition. For every face the app detects, a flow will be triggered. Homey will automatically try to match the faces to a set of known faces that you can upload yourself. The app will also estimate gender, age, emotion, and whether the person is wearing (sun)glasses or a mask.",
